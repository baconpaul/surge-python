# Surge API tutorial

This tutorial is presented as a set of iPython notebooks showing 
the Surge API. It presuposes the following

1. You have a jupyter environment which can see the surge python library
2. You understand surge.

To meet goal 1, checkout the surge project and build and install the
targets surgepy and install-resources-local. The script in `scripts/misc`
here shows how to do that on a collab linux instance.

To meet goal 2, we storngly suggest you actually play the surge VST for
a while. The object model in Surge and the UI are very tightly coupled
and the examples here will be much clearer if you understand the
synth.
